            <p>After leaving school in 2016 I joined TU Dublin (ITT back then!) and studied Mechanical Engineering. I studied this for two years but ultimately decided I enjoyed our computer modules over some of the others (Thermodynamics immediately springs to mind!).
                I dropped out of engineering after my 2nd year and went on to study computing.</p>
